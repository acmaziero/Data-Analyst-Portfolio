# Data Analyst Portfolio

Hello, I am Arthur and Welcome to my Portfolio.
I have aBachelor's degree, Specialization, and a Master's degree in International Relations.
These programs have not only equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of global affairs but also honed my research and analytical skills. I have conducted in-depth research on various political issues, analyzing complex subjects, and presenting findings in a clear and concise manner.
And I am currently in a career transition.

My firt real experience with data and excel was during my experience as a Purchase Analyst in Argentina, 
where I used to extract from SAP data about the purchasing process from local units. 
After this process, I used to clean the data and to build dashboards in Excel to help me search 
for insights before presenting them to the local manager. 
Since then  I have actively pursued further learning opportunities to enhance my technical skills. I have completed courses focused on Excel, PowerBI, Google Sheets, SQL and Python which have strengthened my ability to manipulate and analyze data efficiently. 

In this portfolio, I have included some projects to show my skills and track my progress as a data analyst.

I am very excited to bring my background in International Relations along with my technical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst.
